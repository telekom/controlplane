## About

This module provides shared functionality for all [Operators](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) implemented using [kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder).
It contains the following components:

- **Controller**: The controller implements the reconciliation logic for a single custom resource (CR). It contains common logic for all controllers, such as handling finalizers, status updates, and error handling. It uses a **Handler** to process the CR.
- **Handler**: The handler is called by the controller to process the CR. It can either be a `deletion` or `createOrUpdate` request. The handler is responsible for reaching the desired state of the CR and needs to be implemented by the specific operator.
- **ScopedClient**: This client is a wrapper around the default kubebuilder client. It provides a simplified interface and is also context-aware. That means that it supports [virtual environments](#virtual-environments)
- **JanitorClient**: This client is an extension of the `ScopedClient`. It is used to clean up resources that are no longer needed.

In addition to these components, the module also provides some common utilities and interfaces that are used by the controllers and handlers. These include:

- **Condition**: This package provides a set of utilities for managing conditions on CRs. See [Conditions](#conditions) for more information.
- **Types**: This package provides some common types that are used by the controllers and handlers. These include the `Object` interface, which is an extension to the kubebuilder `Object` interface
- **Util**: This package provides some common utilities including context and labels
- **Config**: This package provides a set of default configurations that can be used by the controllers. See [Config](pkg/config/config.go) for more information.

## Controller and Handler Flow

The controller contains common logic and are used by all operators:

1. **Fetch**: Get the CR that is referenced by the event. If its not found, just return.
2. **Environment Detection**: Get the environment from the CR. If it is not set, set the CR to blocked and return.
3. **Context Injection**: Inject the `ScopedClient` into the current context. This client is used to interact with the Kubernetes API and is aware of the environment.
4. **Handle**: Call the handler to process the CR. The handler is responsible for reaching the desired state of the CR. It can either be a `deletion` or `createOrUpdate` request.
5. **Error/Success**: If the handler returns an error, start the error-handling. If not, requeue the CR with a jitter.


The following diagram shows the flow of the controller and handler:

## Virtual Environments

Each custom resource (CR) is located in an environment. The environment is determined by the controller by extracting it from the labels of the CR. If it is not set, the controller will set the CR to blocked and it will not be processed. 

This is done to virtualize a Kubernetes cluster and to run multiple controlplane instances in a single cluster.

## Conditions 

We use the conditions feature that Kubernetes offers. See [docs](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#typical-status-properties) for more information.

The following conditions are used:

- **Ready**: This condition indicates that the CR is ready. It can have any Reason and Message but a common one is `Done`.
- **Processing**: This condition indicates that the CR is being processed. It can have any Reason and Message but a common one is `Blocked`.


## Scripts

- **install_crds**: See [install_crds](scripts/install_crds/README.md) for more information


## Getting Started

For any relevant commands, you can use the provided [Makefile](./Makefile) to build and test the project.
To get started, you need to follow the steps described in the [kubebuilder docs](https://book.kubebuilder.io/getting-started).

After scaffolding the project, you can use the common module:

```go
// This struct is generated by kubebuilder
type MyResourceReconciler struct {
	client.Client
	Scheme   *runtime.Scheme
	Recorder record.EventRecorder

	controller.Controller[*v1.MyResource] // We extend it using the controller
}

func (r *MyResourceReconciler) SetupWithManager(mgr ctrl.Manager) error {
	r.Recorder = mgr.GetEventRecorderFor("myresource-controller")
  // Our handler implement the handler.Handler[Object] interface
  handler := &MyResourceHandler{}
	r.Controller = controller.NewController(handler, r.Client, r.Recorder) 

	return ctrl.NewControllerManagedBy(mgr).
		For(&v1.MyResource{}).
		Complete(r)
}

func (r *MyResourceReconciler) Reconcile(ctx context.Context, req ctrl.Request) (ctrl.Result, error) {
  // In the Reconcile function that is required by the reconcile.Reconciler interface, we call the controller
  // to handle the request.
	return r.Controller.Reconcile(ctx, req, &v1.MyResource{})
}
```

All your business logic should be implemented in the `MyResourceHandler` struct (see [example](./pkg/handler/nop.go)). The controller will take care of the rest.
Additionally, your resource `MyResource` must implement the `Object` interface.
