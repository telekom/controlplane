# Secret Manager CLI Client

# About


You can use this client to debug, test, and interact with the Secret Manager service.


## Local Deployment
If the Secret Manager service is running locally (`http://localhost:8443/api`), you can use the following command to run the client:

```bash
# First, start the Secret Manager service locally
go run cmd/server/server.go --disable-tls

# Then, run the client against the local service
go run cmd/client/client.go --env foo 
```

This assumes that the service has been started without TLS and is accessible at `http://localhost:8443/api`.


## Remote Deployment
If the Secret Manager service is deployed remotely, you can specify the base URL of the service using the `--url` flag.
If the service is also secured using the k8s-authenticator, you will need to provide a valid access token using the `--token`  or `--token-file` flag.

```bash
# First, create a proxy to the remote service
kubectl -n secret-manager-system port-forward svc/secret-manager 8443:443

# Then, get an access token for the relevant service account
export NAMESPACE="secret-manager-system"
export SERVICE_ACCOUNT="secret-manager"
export TOKEN=$(kubectl create token -n $NAMESPACE $SERVICE_ACCOUNT --duration 10m)

# Finally, run the client with the remote URL and token
go run cmd/client/client.go --url https://localhost:8443/api --token $TOKEN --env foo
```
