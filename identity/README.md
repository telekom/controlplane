## About

The Identity domain provides a Kubernetes-native way to manage identity and access management resources through Keycloak integration. It extends Kubernetes with custom resources to create and manage identity providers, realms, and clients in a declarative way.


The API is designed to be independent of the underlying IDP technology, allowing for flexibility in choosing the best solution for your needs.
However, at the moment, the implementation is tightly coupled with [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/documentation).

The following diagram illustrates the architecture of the Identity domain:
