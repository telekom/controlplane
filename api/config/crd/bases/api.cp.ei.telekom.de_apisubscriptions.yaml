                    ObjectRef is a reference to a Kubernetes object
                    It is similar to types.NamespacedName but has the required json tags for serialization

                        UID is a type that holds unique ID values, including UUIDs.  Because we
                        don't ONLY use UUIDs, this is an alias to string.  Being a type captures
                        intent and helps make sure that UIDs and names do not get conflated.
