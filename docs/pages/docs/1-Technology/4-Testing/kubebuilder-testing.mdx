  title="Kubebuilder Testing"
  description="Testing Kubernetes controllers with in-memory API server"
/>

The Control Plane uses Kubebuilder's testing framework to validate controller behavior using an in-memory Kubernetes API server.

<InfoSection type="info" title="Controller testing">
  Testing Kubernetes controllers requires a special approach since they interact with the Kubernetes API server. Kubebuilder provides tools to set up an in-memory API server for efficient and reliable testing.
</InfoSection>

## Overview

Kubebuilder's testing framework, built on the `controller-runtime` library's `envtest` package, allows you to test controllers without a real Kubernetes cluster. This approach offers several advantages:
