[Ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo) is a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) testing framework for Go that is used in the Control Plane for writing expressive tests.

<InfoSection type="info" title="Behavior-Driven Development">
  Ginkgo encourages writing tests that describe the behavior of your application in a way that's easy to understand for both developers and non-technical stakeholders.
</InfoSection>

## Overview

Ginkgo is designed to make writing and running tests productive and enjoyable. It integrates with Go's built-in testing package but offers a more expressive and feature-rich approach to testing.

## Integration in the Control Plane

<InfoSection type="tip" title="BDD for complex scenarios">
  In the Control Plane, Ginkgo is particularly valuable for testing complex behaviors like API interactions and controller reconciliation loops.

## Testing with Kubernetes envtest

<InfoSection type="tip" title="Kubernetes integration">
  Ginkgo works seamlessly with the Kubernetes envtest package, making it ideal for testing controllers in the Control Plane.
</InfoSection>

## Ginkgo CLI

Ginkgo provides a powerful command-line interface for running tests:

```bash
# Install the Ginkgo CLI
go install github.com/onsi/ginkgo/v2/ginkgo@latest

# Run all tests in current package
ginkgo

# Run tests in watch mode (rerun on file changes)
ginkgo watch

# Run tests in specific packages
ginkgo ./pkg/controllers/... ./pkg/apis/...

# Generate test coverage report
ginkgo -cover -coverprofile=coverage.out

# Run tests in parallel
ginkgo -p

# Focus on specific tests
ginkgo --focus "FileManager"

# Skip specific tests
ginkgo --skip "Database"
```
