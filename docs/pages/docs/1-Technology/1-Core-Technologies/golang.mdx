<PageHeader 
  title="Go Language"
  description="The foundation of the Control Plane's architecture"
/>

The Control Plane is primarily implemented in Go version 1.24.4, taking advantage of the language's concurrency features, strong typing, and excellent standard library.

<InfoSection type="info" title="Go in the Control Plane">
  Go serves as the foundational programming language for the Control Plane, powering its microservices, operators, and shared libraries. Its performance characteristics and ecosystem make it ideal for cloud-native applications.
</InfoSection>

## Overview

Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google. It combines the efficiency of compiled languages with the ease of use and safety of modern languages. The Control Plane uses Go for its exceptional performance, excellent standard library, and powerful concurrency model that's perfectly suited for cloud-native applications.

        <p>We follow these organization principles:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Package by feature, not by layer</li>
          <li>Keep related code together</li>
          <li>Minimize package dependencies</li>
          <li>Use internal packages for implementation details</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Return errors rather than panicking</li>
          <li>Use error wrapping for context</li>
          <li>Create custom error types when needed</li>
          <li>Always check returned errors</li>
