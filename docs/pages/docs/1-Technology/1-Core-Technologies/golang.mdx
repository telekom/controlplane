<PageHeader 
  title="Go Language"
  description="The foundation of the Control Plane's architecture"
/>

The Control Plane is primarily implemented in Go version 1.24.4, taking advantage of the language's concurrency features, strong typing, and excellent standard library.

<InfoSection type="info" title="Go in the Control Plane">
  Go serves as the foundational programming language for the Control Plane, powering its microservices, operators, and shared libraries. Its performance characteristics and ecosystem make it ideal for cloud-native applications.

    title="Code Organization"
    description={
      <>
        <p>We follow these organization principles:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Package by feature, not by layer</li>
          <li>Keep related code together</li>
          <li>Minimize package dependencies</li>
          <li>Use internal packages for implementation details</li>

  <FeatureCard
    title="Error Handling"
    description={
      <>
        <p>Our error handling practices include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Return errors rather than panicking</li>
          <li>Use error wrapping for context</li>
          <li>Create custom error types when needed</li>
          <li>Always check returned errors</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Write table-driven tests</li>
          <li>Use subtests for better organization</li>
          <li>Mock dependencies for unit tests</li>
          <li>Use testify for assertions</li>
