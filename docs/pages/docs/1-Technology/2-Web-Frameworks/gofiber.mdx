  title="Gofiber Web Framework"
  description="High-performance web framework for the Control Plane's API services"
/>

The Control Plane uses Gofiber v2.52.8 as its primary HTTP framework, particularly in the file-manager and secret-manager components.

<InfoSection type="info" title="Performance-focused HTTP framework">
  Gofiber is an Express-inspired web framework for Go built on top of Fasthttp, providing exceptional performance while maintaining developer-friendly APIs.
</InfoSection>

## Introduction to Gofiber

[Gofiber](https://gofiber.io/) is an Express-inspired web framework for Go that's built on top of Fasthttp, the fastest HTTP engine for Go. It provides a robust set of features with minimal overhead and maximum performance.

## Why Gofiber?

<FeatureGrid columns={2} features={[
  {
    title: "⚡ Performance",
    description: "Built on Fasthttp, offering high throughput and low latency for API services."

  },
  {
    title: "🗂️ Route grouping",
    description: "Structured API organization through logical grouping of related endpoints."
  }
]} />

<InfoSection type="tip" title="Routing best practices">
  Group related endpoints under a common prefix and apply shared middleware to route groups rather than individual routes. This keeps your code DRY and makes middleware management more maintainable.
</InfoSection>



## JWT Authentication

<InfoSection type="note" title="Secure by default">
  All API endpoints in the Control Plane are secured by JWT authentication middleware by default, with specific public routes explicitly marked as unauthenticated.
</InfoSection>

## Custom Middleware

The project includes several custom middleware components built on Gofiber:

  }
]} />

## Integration with OpenAPI

<InfoSection type="tip" title="Code generation">
  The Control Plane uses OpenAPI specifications to generate server stubs, ensuring API documentation and implementation are always in sync.
</InfoSection>

## Error Handling

<InfoSection type="warning" title="Consistent error responses">
  Always use Gofiber's structured error handling to ensure consistent error responses across all APIs. This improves client experience and debuggability.
</InfoSection>
