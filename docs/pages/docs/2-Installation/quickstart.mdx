This guide will help you quickly set up a development environment and deploy the Control Plane on a local Kubernetes cluster.

<InfoSection type="tip" title="What you'll accomplish">
  By the end of this guide, you'll have:
  <ul>
    <li>A running local Kubernetes cluster</li>
    <li>The Control Plane components installed and running</li>
    <li>Sample resources deployed to verify functionality</li>
  </ul>
</InfoSection>

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following tools installed:

<FeatureGrid columns={3} features={[
  {
    title: "🔄 kind",
    description: "Kubernetes in Docker - for running a lightweight local cluster."
  },
  {
    title: "🎮 kubectl",
    description: "Kubernetes command-line tool for cluster management."
  },
  {
    title: "🔑 GitHub CLI",
    description: "Used for authentication with GitHub repositories."
  }
]} />

All tools can be installed following their official documentation:
- [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)

## Setup Process

<CardGrid columns={3}>
  <FeatureCard
    title="Step 1"
    description="Prepare Local Kind Cluster"
    icon="1️⃣"

  <FeatureCard
    title="Step 2"

  <FeatureCard

    icon="3️⃣"
  />
</CardGrid>

### Step 1: Prepare Local Kind Cluster

First, we'll create a kind cluster and prepare it for the Control Plane installation.

```bash
# [optional] clone the controlplane repo
git clone --branch main https://github.com/telekom/controlplane.git
cd controlplane

# kind cluster
kind create cluster

# namespace
kubectl create namespace secret-manager-system

# gh-auth
export GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token)

# install
bash ./install.sh --with-cert-manager --with-trust-manager --with-monitoring-crds
```

<InfoSection type="note" title="What happens in this step">
  We create a Kubernetes cluster using kind, set up the required namespace, configure GitHub authentication, 
  and install necessary dependencies like certificate management and monitoring components.
</InfoSection>

### Step 2: Install Control Plane

Now that we have a Kubernetes cluster with the necessary dependencies, we can install the Control Plane components. 
The Control Plane consists of multiple controllers and custom resources that work together to manage workloads across 
Kubernetes clusters.

```bash
# Navigate to the installation directory
cd install/local

# Apply the Kustomization to install controlplane components
kubectl apply -k .

# Verify the installation by checking the controller-manager pods
kubectl get pods -A -l control-plane=controller-manager
```

You should see the Control Plane controller pods running. The controllers are responsible for reconciling the custom 
resources and managing the platform.

<InfoSection type="tip" title="Developer mode">
  If you want to develop and test your own controllers against the Control Plane, please refer to the 
  <a href="./installation">Installation Guide</a> and the section "Development: Testing Local Controllers" for detailed instructions.
</InfoSection>

### Step 3: Install Sample Resources

To verify that the Control Plane is working correctly and to understand its functionality, we'll deploy some sample 
resources. The Control Plane uses a hierarchical resource model with admin, organization, and rover resources.

<CardGrid columns={3}>
  <FeatureCard
    title="Admin Resources"
    description="Define infrastructure foundation, including zones, clusters, and platform configurations."
  />
  
  <FeatureCard
    title="Organization Resources"
    description="Represent teams and projects that use the platform with ownership and permissions."
  />
  
  <FeatureCard
    title="Rover Resources"
    description="Represent the actual workloads that run on the platform, scheduled based on requirements."
  />
</CardGrid>

#### Admin Custom Resources

Admin resources define the infrastructure foundation, including zones, clusters, and platform-level configurations. 
These resources are typically managed by platform administrators.

```bash
kubectl apply -k resources/admin

# Verify
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready -n controlplane zones/dataplane1
```

#### Organization Custom Resources

Organization resources represent teams and projects that use the platform. These resources define ownership, 
permissions, and organizational boundaries.

```bash
kubectl apply -k resources/org

# Verify
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready -n controlplane teams/phoenix--firebirds
```

#### Rover Custom Resources

Rover resources represent the actual workloads that run on the platform. Rovers are deployable units that can be 
scheduled on different clusters based on requirements and zone capabilities.

```bash
kubectl apply -k resources/rover

# Verify the rover is ready
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready -n controlplane--phoenix--firebirds rovers/rover-echo-v1
```

## Verification & Troubleshooting

### Expected Results

After successful installation, you should see:

<FeatureGrid columns={3} features={[
  {
    title: "✅ Controller Pods",
    description: "Running in the controlplane namespace"
  },
  {
    title: "✅ Custom Resources",
    description: "All resources in Ready state"
  },
  {
    title: "✅ Team Namespace",
    description: "Created for the sample team (controlplane--phoenix--firebirds)"
  }
]} />

### Checking Resource Status

```bash
# Check all controlplane resources
kubectl get zones,teams,rovers -A

# Check that rover workloads are deployed
kubectl get pods -n controlplane--phoenix--firebirds
```

### Common Issues

If you encounter issues during the installation, here are some common troubleshooting steps:

<CardGrid columns={3}>
  <FeatureCard
    title="Controller Logs"
    description={<>
      <p>Check the controller logs:</p>
      <code>kubectl logs -n controlplane deploy/controlplane-controller-manager -c manager</code>
    </>}
  />
  
  <FeatureCard
    title="CRD Verification"
    description={<>
      <p>Verify that all custom resource definitions are installed:</p>
      <code>kubectl get crds | grep controlplane</code>
    </>}
  />
  
  <FeatureCard
    title="Namespace Check"
    description={<>
      <p>Ensure the correct namespace is created for your resources:</p>
      <code>kubectl get ns | grep controlplane</code>
    </>}
  />
</CardGrid>
