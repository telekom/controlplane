## Architecture Overview

<InfoSection type="info" title="Modular design">
  The Control Plane follows a modular architecture with specialized components that work together to provide a complete platform for API management and workload orchestration. This approach enables extensibility, maintainability, and scalability.
</InfoSection>

The Control Plane architecture is built on cloud-native principles, using Kubernetes as its foundation and extending it with custom controllers and resources to create a comprehensive platform for managing APIs and workloads.

## Component Architecture

The diagram below illustrates how the different components of the Control Plane interact with each other and with external systems:

<div className="card">
  <div className="card__header">
    <h3>Component Architecture</h3>

  <div className="card__body">
    <p>The Control Plane consists of operators, API servers, and libraries that interact with Kubernetes and external infrastructure components:</p>

  </div>
  <div className="card__footer">
    <p><strong>Key interactions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Operators use the Kubernetes API to manage custom resources</li>
      <li>API Servers provide RESTful interfaces for clients and services</li>
      <li>Integration with external components like Gateway and Identity Providers</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

## Architectural Layers

The Control Plane architecture is organized into several logical layers:

```mermaid

    User[User/Client] -->|interacts with| API[API Layer]
    API -->|uses| Controller[Controller Layer]
    Controller -->|manages| Resource[Resource Layer]
    Resource -->|stored in| Storage[Storage Layer]
    Storage -->|persisted in| K8s[Kubernetes API]
    
    classDef primary fill:#E20074,color:#ffffff,stroke:#E20074
    classDef secondary fill:#9B287B,color:#ffffff,stroke:#9B287B
    
    class API,Controller primary
    class Resource,Storage,K8s secondary
```

</CardGrid>

  <FeatureCard
    title="Object Storage"
    description="S3-compatible storage used for storing files and other binary data that doesn't fit well in etcd."
  />
</CardGrid>

## Data Flow Architecture

<InfoSection type="note" title="Data Flow">
  Understanding the data flow between components helps in troubleshooting and optimizing the Control Plane.
</InfoSection>

The following diagram illustrates the data flow between major components of the Control Plane:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User/Client
    participant API as API Server
    participant Operator as Operator
    participant K8s as Kubernetes API
    participant Infra as Infrastructure Services
    
    User->>API: Request resource creation
    API->>K8s: Create Custom Resource
    K8s-->>API: Resource created
    API-->>User: Success response
    
    K8s->>Operator: Watch event (resource created)
    Operator->>K8s: Read related resources
    K8s-->>Operator: Return related resources
    Operator->>Operator: Process resources
    Operator->>Infra: Create/Update infrastructure
    Infra-->>Operator: Infrastructure updated
    Operator->>K8s: Update resource status
    K8s-->>Operator: Status updated
```

## Security Architecture

Security is a fundamental aspect of the Control Plane architecture, implemented at multiple levels:

<CardGrid columns={2}>
  <FeatureCard
    title="Authentication"
    description="Uses OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication of users and services. Integrates with identity providers like Keycloak."
  />
  <FeatureCard
    title="Authorization"
    description="Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) determines what actions users and services can perform on resources."
  />
  <FeatureCard
    title="Network Security"
    description="Network Policies restrict communication between components, ensuring that only authorized traffic is allowed."
  />
  <FeatureCard
    title="TLS Encryption"
    description="All communication between components is encrypted using TLS certificates managed by cert-manager."
  />
</CardGrid>

## High Availability Architecture

For production deployments, the Control Plane supports a high availability configuration:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph ZoneA["Zone A"]
        OpA[Operators]
        APIA[API Servers]
        InfraA[Infrastructure]
    end
    
    subgraph ZoneB["Zone B"]
        OpB[Operators]
        APIB[API Servers]
        InfraB[Infrastructure]
    end
    
    subgraph ZoneC["Zone C"]
        OpC[Operators]
        APIC[API Servers]
        InfraC[Infrastructure]
    end
    
    LB[Load Balancer] --> OpA & APIA & OpB & APIB & OpC & APIC
    
    classDef zoneStyle fill:#E20074,color:#ffffff,stroke:#E20074
    class ZoneA,ZoneB,ZoneC zoneStyle
```

Key aspects of the high availability design:

1. **Multi-Zone Deployment**: Components are deployed across multiple availability zones
2. **Stateless Design**: Core components are stateless, storing all state in Kubernetes resources
3. **Redundant Components**: Multiple replicas of each component ensure continued operation if some fail
4. **Load Balancing**: Distributes requests across available replicas

## Scalability Architecture

The Control Plane is designed for horizontal scalability:

<CardGrid columns={2}>
  <FeatureCard
    title="Component Scaling"
    description="Individual components can be scaled independently based on load and performance requirements."
  />
  <FeatureCard
    title="Resource Efficiency"
    description="Components are designed to use resources efficiently, with configurable resource requests and limits."
  />
  <FeatureCard
    title="Stateless Design"
    description="Stateless components can be scaled out without coordination, simplifying scaling operations."
  />
  <FeatureCard
    title="Controlled Dependencies"
    description="Minimal dependencies between components reduce the coordination required during scaling events."
  />
</CardGrid>

## Integration Architecture
